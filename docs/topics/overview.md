# Overview

TensorFlow Lite is an open source software library for running machine learning models on mobile and embedded devices. For more information, see [www.tensorflow.org/lite](http://www.tensorflow.org/lite).

For memory constrained devices, the library contains TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers. For more information, see [www.tensorflow.org/lite/microcontrollers](WWW.TENSORFLOW.ORG/LITE/MICROCONTROLLERS).

The MCUXpresso Software Development Kit \(MCUXpresso SDK\) provides a comprehensive software package with a pre-integrated TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers based on version 24-08-07 \(from the 7th of August 2023\). This document describes the steps required to download and start using the library. Additionally, the document describes the steps required to create an application for running pre-trained models.

**Note:** The document also assumes knowledge of machine learning frameworks for model training.
